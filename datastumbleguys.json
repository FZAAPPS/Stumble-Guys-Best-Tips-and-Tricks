		"description": "Ever since its inception, Fall Guys has been creating shockwaves in the gaming community, with its simple yet very entertaining multiplayer gameplay, and a wide variety of maps to keep the matches fresh on every round. And like with anything that becomes massively popular, similar games inevitably started to pop up, with Stumble.Now, while it’s easy to dismiss it as a copycat, Stumble Guys actually do its own fair share of things right. For starters, it launched first as a mobile-exclusive title, making it the best Fall Guys-style multiplayer game for smartphones, which says a lot. Secondly, while the gameplay is very reminiscent of the original, Stumble Guys have its own mechanics, as well as its own unique repertoire of maps and obstacle courses. In this regard, you can consider this game as an extension of the original—whenever you get bored of the maps in Fall Guys, you can switch to Stumble Guys, and vice versa.",

		"description": "In Fall Guys, the original game that spawned this online gaming phenomenon, players can not only jump and dive, but they can also grab and pull their rivals to disrupt their movements and completely kill their momentum. This action is very useful for making your rivals miss their jumps, fall to their dooms, and possibly lose their lead during any of the maps. In Stumble Guys, however, there is nothing of the sort; the only actions available on the UI are running with the thumb stick, and jumping with the button on the right. However, there is actually a hidden way to unleash special actions like punching and sliding, both of which can definitely help as they can knock enemies down when used correctly.",
